Rajesh Hamal to Nepal and Nepalese is what Chuck Norris is to Hollywood and Rajanikath is to India / Bollywood. There are countless jokes — some original and most translated/adapted his “powers”. He seems to enjoy those jokes himself, and sometimes, he recites them. The first megastar of Nepalese movie industries, he has that cult following that no other Nepalese actors enjoy. People across three generations call his “Rajesh Dai” (Dai = Brother) with love. While I admit I have not watched his movies in the last decade, this one is for the childhood memory.

Inspired by Jian Yang’s Hot Dog detector app as seen in the TV series Silicon Valley, (It's a great series, check it out!)In this project, I am building a binary image classifier that detects if an image is Rajesh Hamal or Not. I used Rajesh Hamal here, but you can use this on any image class as long as you have enough dataset. Let's get started.
